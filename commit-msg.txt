Fix: Firefox WebGL NPOT warnings and improve fade-past-lines behavior

Dynamic background (Firefox)
- Set CLAMP_TO_EDGE on NPOT cell state textures (8x5) in createCellStateTexture()
- Removes WebGL warnings and prevents solid-color fallback on Gecko

Fade-past-lines UX
- Defer deactivation of finished line when fade-past-lines is active until next line starts
- Avoids brief hide between lines; lets previous line fade naturally with the new one
