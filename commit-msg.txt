Lyrics: improve emphasis, motion, fullscreen fade sync, and background vocals fade behavior

Emphasis tuning
- Tighten emphasis selection to short words only: length <= 7 and duration >= 1000ms
- Narrow emphasis duration range to 1000â€“2000ms for punchier growth
- Increase glow brightness: shadowIntensity from (0.4..0.8) to (0.5..1.0)

Non-emphasized motion
- Make vertical rise more visible for highlighted syllables: translateY from -1.5% to -3.5% (matches YouLyPlus baseline)

Fade-past-lines robustness (fullscreen toggles)
- Persist latest settings on instance (this._currentSettings)
- MutationObserver now reads current settings instead of stale closure
- Add _syncFadePastLinesState() and call after render/update to ensure immediate class toggle when switching fullscreen or updating settings

Background vocals fade behavior (fullscreen + fade-past-lines)
- Keep background-vocal-container expanded on past lines so it fades out together with the main line instead of collapsing early

Files touched
- src/modules/lyrics/lyricsRenderer.js
  * Store _currentSettings; observer uses it
  * Add _syncFadePastLinesState(), call from render/update
  * Emphasis threshold and duration range; glow intensity increase
- src/modules/lyrics/lyrics.css
  * translateY(-3.5%) for highlight baseline
  * In fullscreen fade-past-lines, keep background vocals visible on .past lines
